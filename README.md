WP SVG Support
===============

**Notice: ** This repository is no longer being maintained.  
[SVG Support](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/svg-support/) at wp.org is a good alternative.

Upload and edit SVG files in WordPress.

The plugin aims to implement a full featured SVG Editor that would work the same like the regular Image 
editor in WordPress. 

Currently this is more like a development stub. Only cropping and scaling are supported. 
If you just need to add an svg as a header image to your Blog, this might already be good for you.


Features
--------

- Upload SVG files
- Resize
- Crop


Known Limitations
-----------------

- Rotating and flipping images not supported. 
  The UI elements are just hidden by some hacky css.
